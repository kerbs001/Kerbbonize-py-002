# Kerbbonize-py-002

Kerbbonize, a program made to effortly transform all instances of a color of a pixel into a transparent background. providing an output image that is a frame for all event promotions of a school organization during their DP blasts. 

Please note that while the program excels at creating the frames, image layering behind the frame is still a work-in-progress.
